    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">As a front-end developer I would recommend starting to be wary of what network you connect to. Network security is important in form of protecting exchanges of data across the network. I would make sure I use a modern framework who handles the security automatically. I would always make sure I add security to the development proves as early as possible, because it is harder and more expansive to fix-security bugs and holes later in the process. I would take care of the Data sanitization. It takes control of the permanently deleting or/and destroying the data in storage devices. This to ensure it cannot be recovered. This practice also will ensure that the data system accepts is in the right format. As we go on I would ensure that I make use of a third-party application who is trusted and of course tested. You should also make sure that authorization and authentications are hard to crack. The best way of doing this is to use an open-standard framework. The user of the website (customer) expect that their experience is safe and that the information such as card-details will not be stolen. The customer will always be in good-belief that you protect their data, information and the website from attacks. </p>
